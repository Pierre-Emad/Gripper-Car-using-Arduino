# Gripper_Car

## Overview
Robot car with gripper controlled by joysticks which are connected by bluetooth.
We made this project for the microprocessor course in our college.

## functionality
The main goal of this project was to connect 2 bluetooth modules together in Master-Slave connection type in order to send commands from the controlling device (the joystick) to the car.
The joystick unit is used as the master device while the car unit is used as the salve device.

## Features
- Wireless control using bluetooth.
- Easy to use interface through the 2 joysticks.
- Tilting gripper which allows precise control.
